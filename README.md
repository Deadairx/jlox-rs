Following along with http://craftinginterpreters.com/ to create a programming 
language called Lox. The thing is, it calls for writing in Java on the first 
pass... but I'd rather shoot my foot, so we're using Rust!

I'll be looking at [other people's Rust implementations](https://github.com/
munificent/craftinginterpreters/wiki/Lox-implementations#rust) of Lox for when 
I am less than sure on how to translate the Java code in the book. The point is
to learn how to create a language, not challenge my ability to translate from 
Java to Rust (though this project will have that side effect)

I'll be commiting at the end of each chapter at least, and if I decide to do
the challenges, I'll create branches for those.
